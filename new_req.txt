We need to add the following data to the database:  

1. Pivot Table for Hospitals and Specialties: 
    Create a table that links the `hospitals` and `specialties` tables with a many-to-many relationship.  
2. Reviews Table: 
    Create a `reviews` table that can be linked to multiple types of data (doctors, hospitals, and job ads) 
    using a polymorphic many-to-one relationship.  
3. Update the Mobile App and Dashboard: Make sure these changes are reflected and handled properly in both 
    the mobile app and the dashboard.   


We need to create a new section for healthcare professionals, and their section in the 
mobile app will be removed. Here's what the new section should include:

1. Healthcare Professional Registration Page: 
    A page where healthcare professionals can register their accounts.
2. Profile Pages: 
    Screens for users to view and edit their profiles.
3. Create New Job Page: 
    A screen where users can create job postings, including all the necessary details currently 
    found in the job ad table.
4. Job Ads Overview Screen: 
    A screen that shows all the job ads created by the user.  
    - Job Ad Details: When a user selects a specific job ad, they can view its details, see who has 
    applied, and check if any candidates have been accepted.  
    - Search Link: A link on the job ad details page that takes the user to a new screen to search for 
    healthcare professionals. The search will use the job ad's specialty and job title as filters.
5. Recommendations Screen: 
    A screen to show recommendations for suitable healthcare professionals.  
   - Default View: When the user opens the screen, it shows all healthcare professionals.  
   - Filters: Users can refine the results using filters like job title, specialty, state, district, 
   and reviews.
